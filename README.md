# Project: Darwin World
### The project was completed as part of a course credit in the subject of object-oriented programing

### Key Features:
* **Procedurally Generated World:** A rectangular grid representing steppes with sparse vegetation and dense, plant-rich jungles.
* **Animal Life Cycle:** Creatures in this world seek out food to maintain their energy, with the risk of death if they fail to eat.
* **Genetic Algorithm:** Each animal has a set of genes dictating its behavior, with reproduction resulting in a mix of parental genes and potential mutations.
* **Simulation Parameters:** Various configurable aspects such as map size, plant growth patterns, animal energy levels, and mutation rates.
* **User Interaction:** The JavaFX-based GUI allows users to run simulations with custom configurations, observe real-time animations, and track statistics like animal population, plant count, and dominant genotypes.

### Project Goals:
The Darwin World project aims to simulate millions of years of evolution, observing the emergence of diverse species and behaviors in a self-evolving game environment.

### Configuration Options for Simulation

1. **Parameter Customization**:
   - Adjust various simulation parameters:
     - **Map Size**: Define the dimensions of your world (steppes and jungles).
     - **Plant Growth Patterns**: Set rules for vegetation spread.
     - **Animal Energy Levels**: Determine energy requirements for survival.
     - **Mutation Rates**: Control genetic variability.
   - Customize these parameters to create unique ecosystems.

2. **Data Logging**:
   - Enable **"zapisywanie danych"** (data logging) to record simulation data.
   - All relevant information, such as animal behavior and plant distribution, will be saved to a **CSV file**.
   - Useful for analysis and insights.

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - **Save** your current configuration to a file.
   - **Load** previously saved configurations.
   - Easily revisit specific setups or share them with others.

Explore these options and create fascinating simulations in your **Darwin World** project! üåøü¶éüåç
